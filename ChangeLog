Bionet 2.4.1, 2009 September 21

    * Add bdm_get_last_entry_seq() and bdm_free_hab_list() to BDM client to enable 
      Python bindings to use this feature.

Bionet 2.4.0, 2009 August 18

    * Add BDM Sync feature over TCP and DTN. 
      DTN requires ION 1.0
      NOTE - This breaks database file compatibility, so old BDM database files must i
      be deleted.

    * Fix several blocking IO bugs that could cause HABs and/or clients to become
      unresponsive under certain network conditions

    * test-pattern-hab added that can simulate responses by reading a file.

    * New Build-dependency on flex and bison

    * Add BDM-Plots, a web based BDM data graphing tool

    * Debian (.deb) and Redhat (.rpm) packages available 

    * Many other bug fixes.


Bionet 2.3.0, 2009 June 15

    * Added unsubscribe functionality for HABs, nodes, and resources

    * Added --disable-habs and --disable-clients flags to configure script

    * Added test-pattern HAB

    * Better notice of lost HABs using TCP keep-alive messages

    * Added HAB capability to iPhone Bionet Monitor and allowed screen locking

    * Lots of bug fixes all over

    * General API cleanup: removal of deprecated functions, etc.


Bionet 2.2.0-rc1, 2009 May 20
    
    * Added STTR Rights Notice
    
    * Added notes about using Bionet on Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope)

    * Added stream unsubscribe feature and delete connection capabilities
      to stream-manager
	
	
Bionet 2.2.0-rc0, 2009 May 19

    * Standardized the command-line interfaces of all the HABs and
      Clients.  This might break existing scripts & finger muscle
      memories...

    * Added support for security - basic authentication and
      confidentiality.  Uses OpenSSL.  This is still a work in progress.

    * Added support for running Bionet Clients on the iPhone.  There is
      now an iPhone app similar to bionet-monitor.

    * Lots of bug fixes all over.


Bionet 2.1.2, 2009 March 11

    * Fixed a bug in the subscription model: Clients subscribed to
      datapoints now get their new-datapoint callback called for all
      the datapoints in the new-node message.

    * Lots of bionet-monitor improvements: plots now have a Preferences
      dialog box where the user can control plot scaling.

    * Added capability to skip "lost node" messages in MMOD HAB.

    * Lots of fixes to the Bluetooth Stethoscope HAB.

    * Lots of bug fixes and documentation improvements.

    * Updated copyright notices based on lawyer input...

    * The build system will now use ccache if available.

    * Started adding unit testing with Check.  Need to write more tests.

    * Started porting the stream-manager GUI - not complete yet.


Bionet 2.1.1, 2009 January 27

    * Added C -> Python callbacks. Callbacks can be written in Python and
      registered using the py-prefixed version of the register function.

    * Added several HABs co-developed with Gary Grobe at JSC: speedway,
      pal-650, td-p210, parsec

    * Lots of work on Streams and the Alsa HAB.  Bionet can now send
      audio streams from one place to another.  Added a new example
      "Streamy" HAB showing how to use streams.

    * Ported the CPOD and Stethoscope HABs from the old Bionet 0.5
      codebase to 2.1.

    * Added some shortcut functions in the API to make common operations
      simpler.

    * Added library versioning so that the system linker can correctly
      determine binary compatibility.  Misc other build-system
      improvements.

    * Test improvements and several bug fixes.


Bionet 2.1.0, 2009 January 10

    * New API & network protocol!  Source code and executables are *not*
      backwards compatible with 2.0!

    * Fixed bugs all over.

    * Added Python binding for the HAB library.  Added Python module
      installer.

    * New example HAB: syshealth, which reports system health information.

    * MMOD-HAB only allows one instance per gateway device file

    * BDM server now takes a command-line argument specifying the bdm.db
      file to use.

    * Added the incomplete beginnings of a Stream API.  Not complete yet,
      not ready for use.  This part of the Bionet API will change and
      mature over the next few point releases.


Bionet 2.0.4, 2008 December 18

    * Added bionet-monitor.

    * MMOD-HAB more correctly reports the number of missed messages from
      the Motes.

    * Added a --help argument to the bdm-client, which describes how to
      use it.

    * Added a Python bdm-client which supports CSV and MATLAB
      (tab-delimited) output formats

    * More complete API documentation via Doxygen.

    * 'make install' target now works as expected and python modules
      can be imported from all python scripts

    * Some work on Streams, but it's not yet ready for use.


Bionet 2.0.3, SVN rev 311, release 2008 December 5

      functions.

Bionet 2.0.1, SVN rev 262

      to demonstrate.  This requires swig to build.  Disable building the
      python bindings by giving configure the --disable-python flag.

    * Made bionet_read() and hab_read() non-blocking.

    * Ported the CSA-CP HAB from Bionet 0.5.

    * Ported the MMOD HAB from Bionet 0.5.

    * Started working on a document describing how to port software from
      Bionet 0.5.  So far it only discusses HABs.

      cache.

    * Better logging, better sanity checking, misc bug fixes.


Bionet 2.0.0, SVN rev 228

    * A first crude attempt at a peer-to-peer Bionet.  If it breaks you
      get to keep both pieces.
