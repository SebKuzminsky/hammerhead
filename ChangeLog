Bionet 2.1.0, 2009 January 10

    * New API & network protocol!  Source code and executables are *not*
      backwards compatible with 2.0!

    * Fixed bugs all over.

    * Added Python binding for the HAB library.  Added Python module
      installer.

    * New example HAB: syshealth, which reports system health information.

    * MMOD-HAB only allows one instance per gateway device file

    * BDM server now takes a command-line argument specifying the bdm.db
      file to use.

    * Added the incomplete beginnings of a Stream API.  Not complete yet,
      not ready for use.  This part of the Bionet API will change and
      mature over the next few point releases.


Bionet 2.0.4, 2008 December 18

    * Added bionet-monitor.

    * MMOD-HAB more correctly reports the number of missed messages from
      the Motes.

    * Added a --help argument to the bdm-client, which describes how to
      use it.

    * Added a Python bdm-client which supports CSV and MATLAB
      (tab-delimited) output formats

    * More complete API documentation via Doxygen.

    * 'make install' target now works as expected and python modules
      can be imported from all python scripts

    * Some work on Streams, but it's not yet ready for use.


Bionet 2.0.3, SVN rev 311, release 2008 December 5

    * Commanding of Resources now works, using the bionet_set_resource()
      functions.

    * MMOD-HAB now reports the number of missed messages from the Motes.

    * Now builds on Mac OS X.

    * Improved handling of multiple network endpoints reported by mDNS-SD.

    * Started moving to Doxygen documentation.

    * Misc bug fixes and cleanups all over.


Bionet 2.0.2, SVN rev 268

    * Added BDM, the Bionet Data Manager.

    * MMOD-HAB is now functional.

    * Misc minor bug fixes.


Bionet 2.0.1, SVN rev 262

    * Added Python bindings for Bionet 2 Clients.  Wrote a bionet-watcher.py
      to demonstrate.  This requires swig to build.  Disable building the
      python bindings by giving configure the --disable-python flag.

    * Made bionet_read() and hab_read() non-blocking.

    * Ported the CSA-CP HAB from Bionet 0.5.

    * Ported the MMOD HAB from Bionet 0.5.

    * Started working on a document describing how to port software from
      Bionet 0.5.  So far it only discusses HABs.

    * Added some accessor functions for finding HABs in the Bionet Client
      cache.

    * Better logging, better sanity checking, misc bug fixes.


Bionet 2.0.0, SVN rev 228

    * A first crude attempt at a peer-to-peer Bionet.  If it breaks you
      get to keep both pieces.
