Bionet 2
~~~~~~~~

Bionet 2.0 uses mDNS-SD (multicast DNS with Service Discovery) to find
the peers on the network.  In order for this to work, you need to be
running the avahi-daemon on each host that will run HABs or Clients.


To compile:

    autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make


To see it do something:

    # in one shell:
    cd client/watcher
    ./bionet-watcher

    # in another shell:
    cd hab/random
    ./random-hab


Known issues:
    avahi-daemon does not work correctly in Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) and
    possibly other distributions due to misconfiguration. If the service
    discovery is not working or working inconsistently, edit
    /etc/default/avahi-daemon so that AVAHI_DAEMON_DETECT_LOCAL is set to 0.
    See Ubuntu bug #327362.

    

    ASN.1 Compiler:
    The ASN1c compiler has two known bugs affecting Bionet.

    32-bit machines output an 'error converting ASN INTEGER to native 
    Datapoint value' message when receiving a new-node message or a datapoint
    update message from a 64-bit machine if the message contains a uint32
    resource with a value greater than or equal to 2^31. The new-node is still
    reported (with no known value for the resource), but the datapoint
    update is not.

    32-bit machines will also output an error message (indicating that the 
    server message 'contained an invalid ASN.1 message') if they recieve a 
    new-node or datapoint update message from a 64-bit machine if the message 
    contains an int32 resource with a negative datapoint value.  New-node and 
    datapoint-update callbacks will not called.
