Bionet 2
~~~~~~~~

Bionet 2 uses mDNS-SD (multicast DNS with Service Discovery) to find
the peers on the network.  In order for this to work, you need to be
running the avahi-daemon on each host that will run HABs or Clients.

To compile:

    autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make


To see it do something:

    # in one shell:
    cd client/watcher
    ./bionet-watcher

    # in another shell:
    cd hab/random
    ./random-hab


Known issues:

  Ubuntu 9.0.4 (Jaunty Jackalope):
    avahi-daemon does not work correctly in Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) and
    possibly other distributions due to misconfiguration. If the service
    discovery is not working or working inconsistently, edit
    /etc/default/avahi-daemon so that AVAHI_DAEMON_DETECT_LOCAL is set to 0.
    See Ubuntu bug #327362.

    

  ASN.1 Compiler:
    The ASN1c compiler has two known bugs affecting Bionet.

    32-bit machines output an 'error converting ASN INTEGER to native 
    Datapoint value' message when receiving a new-node message or a datapoint
    update message from a 64-bit machine if the message contains a uint32
    resource with a value greater than or equal to 2^31. The new-node is still
    reported (with no known value for the resource), but the datapoint
    update is not.

    32-bit machines will also output an error message (indicating that the 
    server message 'contained an invalid ASN.1 message') if they receive a 
    new-node or datapoint update message from a 64-bit machine if the message 
    contains an int32 resource with a negative datapoint value.  New-node and 
    datapoint-update callbacks will not called.



  BDM-Sync w/ ION 1.1.0:
    As specified by RFC 5050, Bionet Data Manager sync sends bundles that
    represent logical application units, and under certain situations, BDM sync
    messages can be quite large. Since ION 1.1.0 baseline does not fragment
    or reassemble bundles, so care must be taken to ensure that the sync
    messages will fit in the maximum bundle size supported by the trasport
    being used. 

    After calculating the maximum bundle size for the transport(s) in use, 
    set the 'bunble_mtu' setting in the bdm-sync-sender-config


  Experimental Software:
    bionet-plot and bdmplot2 are in early development stages. They cannot yet 
    handle overlapping subscriptions from multiple web clients.
