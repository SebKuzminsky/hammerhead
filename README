Bionet 2
~~~~~~~~

Bionet 2.0 uses mDNS-SD (multicast DNS with Service Discovery) to find
the peers on the network.  In order for this to work, you need to be
running the avahi-daemon on each host that will run HABs or Clients.


To compile:

    autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make


To see it do something:

    # in one shell:
    cd client/watcher
    ./bionet-watcher

    # in another shell:
    cd hab/random
    ./random-hab


Known issues:
    avahi-daemon does not work correctly in Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) and
    possibly other distributions due to misconfiguration. If the service
    discovery is not working or working inconsistently, edit
    /etc/default/avahi-daemon so that AVAHI_DAEMON_DETECT_LOCAL is set to 0.
    See Ubuntu bug #327362.
