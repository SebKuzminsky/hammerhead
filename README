Bionet 2
~~~~~~~~

Bionet 2.0 uses mDNS-SD (multicast DNS with Service Discovery) to find
the peers on the network.  In order for this to work, you need to be
running the avahi-daemon on each host that will run HABs or Clients.


To compile:

    aclocal
    autoreconf --install --force
    ./configure
    make


To see it do something:

    # in one shell:
    cd client/watcher
    ./bionet-watcher

    # in another shell:
    cd hab/random
    ./random-hab
