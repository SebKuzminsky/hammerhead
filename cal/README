CAL is the Communication Abstraction Layer.  It provides an interface
for the Bionet library to communicate between peer processes.


Each CAL Module lives in its own directory; the name of the directory
is the name of the CAL Module.  The active CAL Modules are listed in
the filenamed CAL-Modules.


Each module must have a Makefile defining (at least) the four targets
"all", "test", "install", and "clean":

    "make all" must compile two object archive files named
    "client/cal-client.a" and "server/cal-server.a" respectively.

    "make test" should run all available tests defined by this module.

    "make install" should copy the two library files to
    $(DESTDIR)/usr/lib.

    "make clean" must clean up.


Each module's cal-client.a must define a variable named "cal_client", of type
cal_client_t.

Each module's cal-server.a must define a variable named "cal_server", of type
cal_server_t.
