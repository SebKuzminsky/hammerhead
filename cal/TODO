CAL-PD should have some internal smarts (below the user-accessed
CAL-PD API but above the CAL-PD module) that does some sanity checks
like filtering duplicate Joins from the module.  All to make the module
simpler.  For example the dnssd cal-pd module reports multiple services
for each publisher: IPv4 and IPv6 on each interface.
