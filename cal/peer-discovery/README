This is a prototype of CAL-PD, the Communication Abstraction Layer for
Peer Discovery.


Each CAL-PD module lives in its own directory; the name of the directory
is the name of the CAL-PD module.


Each module must have a Makefile defining (at least) the two targets
"all" and "clean":

    "make all" must compile an object archive file named "cal-pd.a"
    (deposited into the module's directory).

    "make clean" must clean up.


Each module's cal-pd.a must define a variable named cal_pd. of type
bionet_cal_pd_t.


When you run "make" in the top-level directory (where this README file
lives), it builds all the CAL-PD modules, then builds the all test
executables against all of the modules.
