doesnt do id certs


doesnt provide peer unicast addresses


doesnt follow the design for Leaving (doesnt retransmit the Leaving
packet)


Peer Info conversation:

    doesnt use a nonce (client ip & port is conversation identifier)

    Peer Info Reply short random timeout is missing




network socket management...

    CAL-PD BDP uses two sockets:
    
        * one (port shared by all processes on the host) for listening to mcasts
        
        * one (port unique to each process) for sending mcast & unicast, & receiving unicast

    These are BDP sockets, and have nothing to do with the rest of the application.




CAL-I/BIP needs some sockets too:

    * one per peer for unicast stuff

    * one per topic for mcast subscriptions

    * more?
