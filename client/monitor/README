The bionet-monitor program is a graphical user interface client for viewing
and setting BioNet sensors, parameters, and actuators.


Starting the BioNet Monitor
===========================

To start the BioNet Monitor, run:

./bionet-monitor


Navigating the BioNet Monitor
=============================

The BioNet Monitor only grants visibility into Nodes and Resources that 
are currently on the local ethernet.

The user can use the mouse to expand and collapse the hierarchical listings 
of HABs and Nodes by clicking in the boxes to the left of the various HABs
and Nodes. 

The user can type in the name of the HAB or Node with the keyboard and the 
cursor/highlighter will jump to that HAB or Node. 

The user can expand, collapse, and navigate HABs and Nodes by using the arrow
keys. To move the highlighting towards the bottom of the screen, use the down 
arrow. To expand a HAB or Node, use the right arrow. To Collapse a Node or 
HAB, use the left arrow. 

To select a Resource, highlight it. This will display the information 
about that resource in the Frame on the right side of the screen. You must 
select a Resource in order to change its value.  

To Plot a Resource, you must select that resource first. You can then click 
on the Plot button on the Frame on the right side of the screen. You can also 
use TAB to select the Plot button, and then hit the spacebar to plot. If a 
Resource or Node disconnects, you will not be able to view it or plot data
from that Resource or Node.

To Update a Resource (parameters or actuators only), you must select the 
Resource first. Once the information for that resource is shown in the 
Frame on the right side of the screen, you can click in the box showing the 
value. Or, you can TAB over to the box. To set the Resource value, click on 
the Update Value button, or hit the space bar when the button is selected.
