BDMplot2 is both a Bionet Data Manager Subscriber Client and a Web Server. 

The BDM Client portion subscribes to data specified by a web client.

The Web Server portion is a Twisted server written in Python and responds to AJAX queries with responses containing arrays of datapoints previously recorded by BDMs.


Running BDMPlot2:
- start the python script, bdmplot2.py.

- on the same machine point your web browser at http://localhost:8081/bdmplot


BDMPlot2 can be accessed from other machines using the hostname of the machine running it. Also, the port can be changed by using the '--port' option on the command line.



Known Issues:
- multiple web clients with overlapping subscriptions will cause only one of the clients to get the datapoints for a given resource. Don't do this.
