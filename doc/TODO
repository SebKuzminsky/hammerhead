which cipher?

which hash?

optionally turn off signatures (for high-rate resources)

optionally turn off encryption

node list:

    sequence numbers for node list updates (new-node and lost-node)

    include the seq num in the node-list fingerprint

    timestamps for new-node and lost-node events

Howard Weiss says:

    You mention "Integrity is handled by checksums" but say nothing more.
    Why checksums if you are already using digital signatures which are
    much stronger?

        verify that all messages are signed

AMS:

    Does peer discovery get sent over RAMS?  No.


security:

    stream ciphers need to resync if they loose blocks, block ciphers dont
    (unless you run them in feedback mode?)

    el gamal is a fast public key cipher, but ciphertexts are twice as
    large as their plaintexts

    rsa is a slow public cipher, but ciphertexts are the same size as
    their plaintexts
