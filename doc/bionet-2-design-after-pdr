Overview
~~~~~~~~

Bionet version 2 (hereafter referred to as just Bionet) is a
network-transparent device-driver framework.  It uses secure peer-to-peer
pub/sub communications.

This document is a work-in-progress describing our current thinking
about the Bionet architecture.


Bionet Peers
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Bionet network is made up of a set of peers.  Each Bionet peer is
a process running on a computer.  Peers can join and leave the Bionet
network at any time.  There are two kinds of peers: "Hardware Abstractors"
(HABs) and "Clients".

HABs interface with specific sensors and effectors and export them to
the Bionet network.  HABs are publishers of sensor data and consumers
of effector settings.

Clients get data from HABs and process it, and provide settings for
effectors to HABs.  Clients are subscribers of sensor data and providers
of effector settings.  Clients choose what data they want to subscribe to.


Communications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bionet communication consists of two distinct protocols: Peer Discovery
and Information Exchange.


Peer Discovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Bionet Peer Discovery protocol allows Clients to find HABs on
the network.  All peers start Peer Discovery when they want to join
the Bionet network and end Peer Discovery when they want to leave.
The Peer Discovery protocol uses mDNS/SD.  HABs are mDNS servers and
Clients are mDNS clients.


Information Exchange
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Bionet Information Exchange protocol is a publication/subscribe
protocol built on top of TCP/IP.  The subscription topic space is
federated, with each HAB managing its own topic space.

HABs and Clients are mutually authenticated (FIXME: how?), and the HABs
enforce per-topic authorization of Clients (FIXME: how?).  All Information
Exchange communications use Transport Layer Security (TLS) for privacy.


Bionet Data Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bionet is a "soft realtime" system that aims to disseminate up-to-date
information to interested parties.  The Bionet Data Manager (BDM) is
a component of Bionet that records and provides a historical record of
the data that flows over Bionet.

The BDM joins the Bionet network as a Client.  It subscribes using
the regular Bionet Client interface, and records the data it receives.
Recorded data is made available to the network using a pub/sub protocol
suite similar to the Bionet protocols.  In addition, the BDM communicates
with other BDM processes over DTN, to relay the data and make it available
where it's needed.
