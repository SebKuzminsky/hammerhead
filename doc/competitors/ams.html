<BODY LANG="en-US" DIR="LTR">
<P>Some of the info in this file is taken from the &quot;Bionet/AMS
misalignment paper&quot;, written in December 2008.  That paper is an
in-depth examination of several different (unsatisfactory) ways in
which Bionet could use AMS to communicate.  In this current document
I will try to describe just the specific features of Bionet and AMS
that cause friction.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Overview</H3>
<P>Bionet is a network transparent device driver framework that uses
stateful peer&shy;to&shy;peer pub/sub communications internally.</P>
<P>AMS is a delay tolerant, stateless peer&shy;to&shy;peer pub/sub
communications framework.</P>
<P>This fundamental difference between the two systems shows that
Bionet and AMS are not competing products.  They have different
domains, goals, and capabilities.  Bionet might potentially use AMS
for its communication needs, or AMS might provide the communications
infrastructure for a product that competes with Bionet.</P>
<P>If Bionet were to usesAMS, the collaboration would take the form
of a Bionet CAL module that uses AMS to transit Bionet messages,
instead of (or possibly in addition to) the mDNS-SD/BIP CAL module
Bionet currently uses.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">DTN Pub/Sub</H3>
<P>One of the appealing things advertised by AMS is that it provides
delay tolerant pub/sub communication.  Sounds like just the thing for
Bionet!  However, closer examination of this statement reveals
several problems.</P>
<P>AMS uses BP (RFC 5050) for its delay-tolerant networking needs,
and BP does not guarantee delivery in transmission order.  Bionet
pub/sub conversations are context sensitive - decoding later messages
may required using information contained in earlier messages.  Thus,
to use AMS for the DTN part of the Bionet communications, additional
smarts would be needed in Bionet to undo the message reordering. 
This addition would not be of any use to Bionet on normal,
well-behaved networks where TCP can do its job.</P>
<P>The dynamic nature of the subscription topic set in Bionet also
does not lend itself well to DTN operations.  Delayed networks prefer
pre-positioned subscriptions to more statically chosen topics, and
this is not how the Bionet protocol operates.  The Bionet
subscription model is not a good match for DTNs.</P>
<P>Rather than redesign the Bionet protocol to work over DTN (and
thereby sacrificing some of the things we like about Bionet), we came
up with a new, different protocol that <B>is</B> very DTN friendly,
and that carries Bionet information across DTN.  This is the BDM Sync
Protocol.  This protocol uses pre-positioned static wildcard
subscriptions, and it uses application-level intelligence to
efficiently compress lots of data into small bundles.  It is
resistant to message loss and message reordering.  It works very well
over DTN.</P>
<P>This issue is not a show-stopper, but solving it incurs an
unnecessary cost in terms of code complexity and/or run-time
efficiency.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Subscription topics</H3>
<P>Bionet topics are structured strings.  AMS topics are 16-bit
integers.  Thus Bionet topics would have to be mapped onto the 16-bit
integers somehow, resulting in collisions and superfluously published
information.  Bionet can easily filter out the incorrectly received
information, but at some cost in run-time efficiency.  This cost
grows as the size of the network grows.</P>
<P>Bionet topics are federally managed; each publisher gets its own
corner of the address space to manage as it wants.  When Bionet
Clients register subscriptions, the topics are prefixed with the name
of the publisher (or by grouping operators which can specify multiple
publishers).  In contrast, in AMS, the 16-bit topic space is shared
by all publishers in the “Unit”, so Bionet would need to
subdivide the topic space into “publisher” part and a
“publisher's topic” part (similar to how CIDR specifies a network
part and a host part to an IP address).  The AMS topic space can be
subdivided by “Unit”.  This suggests that each HAB can be in its
own Unit, somewhat alleviating this problem (though not solving it). 
But that work-around has the drawback that each AMS Unit requires its
own Registrar server, leading to a top-heavy network.</P>
<P>The Bionet topic space changes during run-time, as publishers come
and go, and as the publishers add and remove topics in their own
space of topics.  This clashes with the AMS setup where the topic
space is managed by the MIB, and fixed at system startup.</P>
<P>Bionet topic strings can contain wildcard operators that are
expanded by the publisher, so that subscribers can subscribe to
multiple related topics with a single request, and the publisher will
publish all messages on all current and future topics that matches
the wildcard subscription.  I believe no such mechanism exists in
AMS.  This problem could be worked around by first registering a
subscription that will inform the subscriber of all potentially
interesting topics as they come and go, then in the subscriber
registering and unregistering subscriptions for all the topics that
match, as they come and go.  In this workaround there is a window in
between the publisher announcing the new topic and the subscriber
subscribing to it during which data can be published, yet not
received by the subscriber.  It also results in a more chatty
protocol.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Minor other issues</H3>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Peer Discovery.  In Bionet, subscribers currently find
	publishers using multicast Domain Name Service/Service Discovery
	(mDNS-SD, a widely used protocol on the IETF standards track).  AMS
	uses explicit registration/deregistration and query with a network
	of Registrar servers.  Bionet could use the AMS mechanism, but at
	the cost of additional superstructure requirements.</P>
	<LI><P>Bionet publications are one-to-many, meaning each topic is
	published by exactly one publisher.  AMS publications are
	many-to-many, meaning multiple publishers can publish on the same
	topic.  Bionet would have to filter out any messages erroneously
	published by invalid publishers, but that's no big deal.</P>
	<LI><P>Bionet security is implemented and enforced in a p2p way,
	whereas AMS security is centrally managed.</P>
