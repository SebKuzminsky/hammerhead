Exports each sound device as a node, and each subdevice as a stream.
Detects and handles new sound devices coming and old sound devices going
(for example, USB sound devices being plugged and unplugged).


Consumer Streams:

    Each client that connects to a consumer gets its own Playback PCM
    handle, going through dmix.


Producer Streams:

    Each client that connects to a producer gets its own Capture PCM
    handle, going through dsnoop.
