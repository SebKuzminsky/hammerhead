Some notes on the state of the cpod hab:
================================================

The hab correctly connects to the cpod, negotiates parameters for
an rfcomm connection.  After writing anything to the file desctiptor,
we correctly see the data go out to the device, and the acknowledge-
ments from the HCI layer, but we never see the UA command comming back
from the device.  Either I'm sending data correctly and the cpod is 
broken, or I'm sending the data incorrectly, and the cpod isn't
responding.  If the latter is true, we should still see the UA 
command coming back from the cpod's bluetooth layer, as rfcomm 
provides reliable communication.  Whether or not the cpod likes the
data is a different story.  Something is really fishy here...
