To change batteries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If nothing happens when you push the MODE button, the batteries are
probably drained.

1.  Open the big hatch on the back.

2.  Remove the battery pack.

3.  Measure the voltage between the two conductors on the connector.
    If it's less than 8.75 Volts or so, you need new batteries.

4.  Unscrew the two small screws furthest from the connectors (don't
    unscrew the two small screws close to the connector).

5.  Lift the two 9V batteries out by pushing up on the bottoms.

6.  Put two fresh batteries in.  The "-" pole of the battery (the larger
    of the two connectors on the top of the 9V battery) goes in the
    larger of the two holes in the battery holder.

7.  Screw the lid back on the battery holder.

8.  Insert the battery holder into the CSA-CP device by lowering it
    straight down.  You will have to apply some force to mate the
    connectors.

9.  Close the hatch.




To make the CSA-CP record data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just turn on the CSA-CP device.  Hold down the MODE button for about
5 seconds.  It'll start recording data automatically.




How to make the CSA-CP HAB read data from the CSA-CP device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Run "csa-cp-hab --device-file SERIALPORT".

    SERIALPORT specifies the serial port.  On Linux this could be
    "/dev/ttyS0" for the first on-board port, or "/dev/ttyUSB2" for the
    third USB-to-RS232 dongle, or something else. In Windows, it could
    be something like "COM1".

    It will start trying to open that device file.  If the device does
    not exist (for example because the USB dongle is not plugged in),
    it will keep retrying.

    Once it's opened the port it will continuously poll for a CSA-CP
    device, and you're ready for step 2.

2.  Turn on the CSA-CP device by pushing the button labeled "MODE", and
    holding it down until the display says "RELEASE", about 1 second.
    The CSA-CP device will beep.  The MODE button is located on the
    small face of the device below the display.

    The CSA-CP HAB will detect the device and connect to it, and the
    CSA-CP display will say "CONNECT".

    Data will start flowing into Bionet.
