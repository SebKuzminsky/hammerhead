TODO:

If you tell it a device file that does not exist (for example a USB
serial dongle that's not plugged in yet), it doesnt pick it up when you
plug it in later.


Wednesday:
Fix one connection bug (only connects once, and doesn't allow you to re-connect)
Clean the files on the device once they've been downloaded.
Clean up all the prints, change to G_LOG debug/warnings/error.


When we know more info:
Store/Report all the data on the device to Bionet
