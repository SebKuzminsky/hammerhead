syshealth gathers system information and feeds it into Bionet.

It uses a modular architecture, making it easy to add new sources of
system information.  Each source provides an init() and an update()
function.  The main program creates a single Bionet node called "system",
then calls the modules' init() functions, which may add resources to
the node.  The init() functions return -1 on failure (no resources added
to the node) and 0 on success (at least one resource added to the node).
After all the init() functions have been run, the program enters the main
loop, where it periodically wakes up and runs the update() functions of
the modules that returned success from init(), and reports the result
to Bionet.
