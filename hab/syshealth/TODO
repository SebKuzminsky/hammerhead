When i run 'ps -eo pid,rss,cmd | grep my-command', what is the RSS field?
Pages or kilobytes or what?


incorporate sar, mostly for disk i/o and cpu utilization


The main syshealth program should dlopen all the information-source
modules, so they can link against esoteric libraries like libsensors.
This way you can compile optimized code (rather than shelling out to
helper-programs like sensors(1)) without requiring the target system to
have all the libraries installed.
