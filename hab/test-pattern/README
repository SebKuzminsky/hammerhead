-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The test pattern hab simulates a real hab based on a test-pattern input.

The hab accepts two different types of input formats:
 (1) Node Add/Remove Messages
 (2) Datapoint updates

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Node Add/Remove Format

DATE TIME [+|-] NODE_ID
    [RESOURCE_ID1 DATA_TYPE FLAVOR [?|'VALUE']]
    [RESOURCE_ID2 DATA_TYPE FLAVOR [?|'VALUE']]
    [RESOURCE_ID3 DATA_TYPE FLAVOR [?|'VALUE']]

    In this case, the date has the form YYYY-MM-DD. Time has the form
    'HH:MM:SS:UUUUUU', where UUUUUUU is the microsecond time component. To add
    a node, follow the time with a '+'; conversely, to remove a node, use '-'.
    The node id follows the name. 
    If the node also has resources, then any number of resource lines, 
    consisting of the resource id, data type and flavor. If the resource does
    not have a value, finish the line with a question mark. If the resource
    has a value, encase the value in single quotes.
    All resources are added at the same time.

Example:
    Below, the node planets would be added. It has two resources, mercury and 
    venus. Mercury is a binary parameter with an initial value of 0. venus is 
    a uint8 parameter with no initial value.
    10 seconds later, the node planets would be removed.

2009-06-03 15:00:00.000000 + planets
    mercury binary parameter '0'
    venus uint8 Parameter ?

2009-06-03 15:00:10.000000 - planets

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Datapoint Update Format

DATE TIME NODE_ID RESOURCE_ID 'VALUE'

    Resource updates start with the DATE (in a YYYY-MMM-DD format), followed 
    by the TIME (HH:MM:SS:UUUUUU). This is followed by the node id and then 
    the resource name. The update value is encased in single quotes.

Example:
    Below, the node planes' resources mercury and venus are updated with 
    values of 1 and 255, respectively.

2009-06-03 15:00:04.000000 planets mercury '1'
2009-06-03 15:00:04.000000 planets venus '255'


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES:

-Events must be in chronological order.
-The bionet-watcher test-pattern hab output mode is not exact: node add/lost
 events are not timestamped. In order to use the output you must add these 
 timestamps.
-The bionet-watcher test-pattern hab output is also not in chronological order.
 To use it, you must re-arrange the data to be in chronological order.
