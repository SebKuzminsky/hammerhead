in mainline:

    update ChangeLog (look at the log since the previous release)

    update common.am (BIONET_INTERFACE_VERSION and BIONET_RELEASE_VERSION
    at the bottom)

    update version in configure.ac

    update rpm/bionet.spec version number

    update Doxyfile version number

    update the iPhone "Bundle Version" in Info.plist

    make clean ; ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make clean all check test

    commit ChangeLog, common.am, rpm/bionet.spec

    tag with the release number: "bzr tag 2.1.1"

    push to the server (this step is only needed if you're working in
    a stand-alone branch, it's not needed if you're working in a "bound
    branch" aka a "checkout")


on the repo server:

    branch trunk to a release-branch with "bzr branch trunk bionet-2.1.1"


check out the release branch


in the release branch:

    ./autogen.sh

    export VERSION=$(egrep ^BIONET_RELEASE_VERSION common.am | cut -d '=' -f 2) ; cd .. ; tar --exclude .bzr -cjf bionet-$VERSION.tar.bz2 bionet-$VERSION

    test the tarball:

        untar it someplace out of the way

        ./configure && make all check test

    building the release tarball also builds the docs, install them on our webserver: rsync -av doxygen/html/ bioserve.colorado.edu:/var/www/bionet/doc/2.1.1

    create symlink:
    	   rm -f /var/www/bionet-api
	   ln -s /var/www/bionet/doc/2.1.1 /var/www/bionet-api
    
    ensure the quickstart is up to date and then copy the quickstart guide:
    	 scp doc/quickstart.html bioserve.colorado.edu:/data/bionet-release/.

    upload the tarball to bioserve.colorado.edu:/data/bionet-release

    Update the bionet-release apt repository:
     - Wait for the bionet2 pacakges to be built with the version number
       changes
     - For all dists and architectures, copy all the .deb and .changes files
       for this specific version to the reletive directory in
       bioserve.colorado.edu:/data/bionet-release/dists 
     - For all dists, copy all the .dsc itar.gz and _source.changes files for
       this specific version to the reletive directory in
       bioserve.colorado.edu:/data/bionet-release/dists 
     - For newly supported dists, copy and edit the Releas.head file from a
       previous dist
     - cd /data/bionet-release and run:
       - update-source-repo --all-dists --all-comps
       - update-binary-repo --all-dists --all-comps --all-archs /PATH/TO/GPGDIR

    Build iPhone App for AdHoc distribution:
     - Build supporting libs with './configure-make-install-iphone.sh'
     - Open the BioNetMonitor.xcodeproj
     - Select "AdHoc" for the active configuration
     - Select iPhoneDevice 3.0 for the active SDK
     - Build (Cmd-B)
     - Right Click on BioNetMonitor->Products->BioNetMonitor.app and "Reveal in Finder"
     - Zip that up and copy it someplace secret along with the latest "Bionet Demo" AdHoc distribution 
     - Create an ipa:
         - Remove old version of BionetMonitor from iTunes, if present
         - Install into iTunes (Drag the .app) onto iTunes Library
         - In the applications section, find bionet, right click and select "Show in Finder"
         - Copy BioNetMonitor.ipa to release location
     - Create SDK tar files:
         -  make clean; ./configure-make-install-iphone-sim.sh
         -  cd client/iphone
         -  tar czf bionet_sdk.tgz bionet_sdk 
         -  tar czf bionet_simulator_sdk.tgz bionet_simulator_sdk
         -  Copy those .tgz files to the release location (Also copy deps from last release)

    update Wordpress's Download page to link to the correct tarball and contain the current ChangeLog.

    update Wordpress's Changelog page with the latest changelog and tarball link.

    send out an announcement email with links to the tarball, repos and the
    API docs, and the top of the changelog

    update both of the VMs (VMWare and KVM) which are the demo VMs in /data/bionet-release.
    	   - copy them to your machine, uncompress and start them
	   - run 'sudo apt-get update' then 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'
	   - shut them down and recompress them
	   - copy them back to bioserve.colorado.edu
