in mainline:

    update ChangeLog (look at the log since the previous release)

    update common.am (BIONET_INTERFACE_VERSION and BIONET_RELEASE_VERSION
    at the bottom)

    update rpm/bionet.spec version number

    update Doxyfile version number

    make clean ; ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make clean all check test

    commit ChangeLog and common.am

    tag with the release number: "bzr tag 2.1.1"

    push to the server (this step is only needed if you're working in
    a stand-alone branch, it's not needed if you're working in a "bound
    branch" aka a "checkout")


on the repo server:

    branch trunk to a release-branch with "bzr branch trunk bionet-2.1.1"


check out the release branch


in the release branch:

    ./autogen.sh

    export VERSION=$(egrep ^BIONET_RELEASE_VERSION common.am | cut -d '=' -f 2) ; cd .. ; tar --exclude .bzr -cjf bionet-$VERSION.tar.bz2 bionet-$VERSION

    test the tarball:

        untar it someplace out of the way

        ./configure && make all check test

    building the release tarball also builds the docs, install them on our webserver: rsync -av doxygen/html/ bioserve.colorado.edu:/var/www/bionet/doc/2.1.2

    upload the tarball to someplace secret

    send out an announcement email with links to the tarball and the
    API docs, and the top of the changelog


in mainline:

    update ChangeLog & common.am, commit
