# HABs (Hardware Abstractors) are simple Bionet applications which 
# communicate directly with hardware to convert and normalize the
# data coming from a piece of hardware and publish it to all subscribers.
# 
# HABs contain 1 or more Rodes. Nodes allow for groupings of Resources 
# into logical concepts. For example, if the HAB is controlling a
# bluetooth receiver, each bluetooth transmitter connected to the receiver
# would be a node.
#
# Nodes contain 1 or more Resources. Resources are the individual sensors
# or other value producing/receiving items. Following the above example,
# if each bluetooth transmitter has a thermometer and an accelerometer
# the Node would have 2 Resources, 'Temperature-C' and 'Accel'.
#
# Resources are set with Datapoints. Datapoints are a tuple of a timestamp
# and a value. If the hardware is smart enough to provide a timestamp then
# that timestamp can be used in the datapoint, otherwise the timestamp
# will be automatically set to the current time. 
#
# Ideally, the HAB always normalizes the data prior to publishing it. 
# Again following the above example, the bluetooth receiver receives a 
# binary value from the 'Temperature-C' resource. This value is then 
# converted by the HAB to degrees C and then published. The idea here
# is that only the HAB needs to have the specifics about how to convert
# data from this particular device to a useful value. Once it is in a
# "normal" engineering unit then any client can use it or convert it to
# any other engineering unit desired without having to know anything
# about the underlying hardware.
