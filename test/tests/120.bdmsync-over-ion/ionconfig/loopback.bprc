# bprc configuration file for the loopback test.
#	Command: % bpadmin loopback.bprc
#	This command should be run AFTER ionadmin and ltpadmin and 
#	BEFORE ipnadmin or dtnadmin.

#	Ohio University, Oct 2008

# Initialization command (command 1).
#	Use ipn:1.0 as the custodian endpoint of this node.
#	That is, scheme IPN with element_number 1 and service number 0
#	(ipn requires custodian service is zero).
#	Note that this EID must be understood by the node itself, so be sure
#	to add the scheme below.
1 ipn:1.0

# Add an EID scheme.
#	The scheme's name is ipn.
#	The scheme's number is 1.  Note that this number is defined for
#	Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE) schemes ONLY.  All other
#	schemes (dtn for example) should use number -1.
#	This scheme's forwarding engine is handled by the program 'ipnfw.'
#	This scheme's administration program (acting as the custodian
#	daemon) is 'ipnadminep.'
a scheme ipn 1 'ipnfw' 'ipnadminep'

# Add endpoints.
#	Establish endpoints ipn:1.0 ipn:1.1 and ipn:1.2 on the local node.
#	ipn:1.0 is expected for custodian traffic.  The rest are usually
#	used for specific applications (such as bpsink).
#	The behavior for receiving a bundle when there is no application
#	currently accepting bundles, is to queue them 'q', as opposed to
#	immediately and silently discarding them (use 'x' instead of 'q' to
#	discard).
a endpoint ipn 1.0 q
a endpoint ipn 1.1 q
a endpoint ipn 1.2 q

# Add a protocol. 
#	Add the protocol named ltp.
#	Estimate transmission capacity assuming 1400 bytes of each frame (in
#	this case, udp on ethernet) for payload, and 100 bytes for overhead.
a protocol ltp 1400 100

# Add an induct. (listen)
#	Add an induct to accept bundles using the ltp protocol.
#	The duct's name is 1 (this is for future changing/deletion of the
#	induct).
#	The induct itself is implemented by the 'ltpcli' command.
a induct ltp 1 ltpcli

# Add an outduct. (send to yourself)
#	Add an outduct to send bundles using the ltp protocol.
#	The duct's name is 1 (this is for future changing/deletion of the
#	outduct).
#	The outduct itself is implemented by the 'ltpclo' command.
a outduct ltp 1 ltpclo

# Start bundle protocol engine, also running all of the induct, outduct,
# and administration programs defined above
