# Initialization command (command 1).
#	Use ipn:1.0 as the custodian endpoint of this node.
#	That is, scheme IPN with element_number 1 and service number 0

#	Note that this EID must be understood by the node itself, so be sure

# Add an EID scheme.
#	The scheme's name is ipn.
#	The scheme's number is 1.  Note that this number is defined for
#	Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE) schemes ONLY.  All other
#	schemes (dtn for example) should use number -1.
#	This scheme's forwarding engine is handled by the program 'ipnfw.'
#	This scheme's administration program (acting as the custodian
#	daemon) is 'ipnadminep.'
a scheme ipn 'ipnfw' 'ipnadminep'

# Make some persistent endpoints for testing - change to suit
a endpoint ipn:1.0 q
a endpoint ipn:1.1 q
a endpoint ipn:1.2 q

# Add a protocol.

# Add an induct. (listen)

# Add an outduct. (send to yourself)
